        <p>No. We're on the top. Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot
            how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Bender, we're trying our best. 
        I'm a thing. Really?! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</p>
        <p>Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex.
            Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? When the lights go out, 
        it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
        <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. We need rest.
            The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. It's just like the story of the
            grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter,
            while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came,
            and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. 
        Is any of this getting through to you?</p>
